Hello there,
This is the first entry (hopefully of plenty) of my logbook, I always want to write a blog... more than a blog a log with records of things I study, learn, work, or only that I am interested about it.

I tried that at first in a moleskin notebook, but it was hard to organize and sometimes hard to read, then I try to do it in my tablet but that wasn't easy to follow and even more difficult to update, so I decided to use the only tool I know to use well for organize, update and preserve things "git". 

Hesitating between LATEX and Markdown, a mixed solution would be alright, that is quite dull and even if I'm the only reader and the subjects that I want to write about are not that hard, it does required concerted effort, an enormous amount of imagination and if anyone other than me read the record (you in this case)  would fall in a long "why recursion" not having the same framework that I in the moment of the log was write it down.

Well to avoid that, I need to follow the explanation with a beautiful example, something to diminish the brain load, easy to grasp and at the same time reduce it to the most elementary parts when making the example, as Richard Feynman wrote " What I cannot create, I do not understand" that I loosely transform  in "if I understand the subject well I can create a shader to visualize it"

So, this is my main objective create a concise explanation and a  interactive example. hope that this can be helpful to any other person that me, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any question
